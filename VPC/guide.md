Step 1: Create the VPC
Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the VPC Dashboard.

Click on "Your VPCs" from the navigation pane on the left side.

Click on "Create VPC".

Configure the VPC:

Name Tag: Give your VPC a name (e.g., MyBasicVPC).
IPv4 CIDR block: Enter an IP range (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16). This defines the IP address range for your VPC.
IPv6 CIDR block: Leave as No IPv6 CIDR Block unless you need IPv6.
Tenancy: Choose Default unless you have specific requirements for dedicated instances.
Click "Create VPC".
